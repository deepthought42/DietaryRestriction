This app is designed to allow a user to quickly identify if they
will experience an allergic reaction to a food product by identifying
any ingredients in the product and cross referencing known allergies
for each ingredient with the user's allergies. 

You will see in the app that there are 4 objects, user, product, allergy, 
and ingredient. A product is defined as an item that is found in a 
grocery store containing a barcode. Allergies and ingredients are just
like they sound. A product has many ingredients and allergies. A user
has many allergies. 

This app is built thus far with Ruby on Rails, and Angular.js as well as
a few other javascript libraries to make it look nice.

Requirements:

	Ruby >=1.9.2
	Rails 3
